# Tumor microbiome analysis pipeline
R codes to analyze the microbial communities from different pancreatic tumor subtypes. The pipeline includes tumors clustering, microbial profiles building, differential abundant microorganisms identification, microbial diversity measurement, microbial functional characterization and correlation between host gene expression and microbiome etc. 

The code files here are linked to the work "Tumor microbiome contributes to an aggressive phenotype in the basal-like subtype of pancreatic cancer" by Wei Guo et al.
